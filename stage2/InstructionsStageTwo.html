    In part two of the experiment you will be presented with 32 different choice screens. On each of these screens you will be presented with a list of choices for you to make. The first option will be the same in each choice: it will be an amount of money that you will receive today, plus the chance of receiving some money in one month's time. The second option will change in each choice. It will be a fixed amount of money today, plus a certain amount of money in one month's time. As you go down the list of choices, the second option will get better, because the amount you receive in one month's time will increase.
    <br/><br/>
    Here is an example of the type of choices you will be asked to make:
    <br/><br/>

    <br/><br/>
    In this example, the option on the left lets you receive $1 today, and Lottery A, which is 40% chance of receiving $10.20 and 60% chance of receiving $0 in one month. The user selected they would choose the option on the left until they are guaranteed $1 today and $4.50 in one month. 
    <br/><br/>
    Because the first option remains the same and the second option gets better as you go down the list, it makes sense that your choices will "switch" at some point from the first to the second option. 
    <br/><br/>
   In order to help you fill in your choices on each screen, the program is designed so that you only need to click on one line. If you click on the first option on that line, the program will automatically select the first option for that line and all those above, and the second option on all lines below. If you select the second option on that line, it will select the second option on that line and all the lines below, and the first option on all the lines above.
   <br/><br/>
    So, in order to select choices like the one above, you could either select the option on the left over $1 today and $4 for sure, or $1 today and $4.50 in one month over the option on the left on the line below it. 
   <br/><br/>
    Once you have clicked on a particular option, you can always change your choice by clicking on a different option on a different line.
    <br/><br/>
    Once you are happy with your choices on a screen you can move onto the next screen by clicking the 'finish' button at the bottom of the screen
    <br/><br/>
    One question screen will be selected at random from this part of the experiment, and one line selected at random from that screen. You will receive whichever option you chose on that line, so you should think about all your choices carefully.
