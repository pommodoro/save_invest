                  Let's consider a scenario with the following features.<br>
                  You have $10 <br>
                  The probability of Asset A being selected for payment is 60% (meaning that the probability that Asset B is selected for payment is 40%) <br>
                  The rate of return for Asset A is 1.2<br>
                  The rate of return for Asset B is 1.3<br>
                  Suppose you chose to receive $2 today, invested $3 in Asset A, and invested $5 in Asset B<br>
                  Please answer the following questions. Express probabilities in whole numbers, so for example for 55% type in 55<br>
